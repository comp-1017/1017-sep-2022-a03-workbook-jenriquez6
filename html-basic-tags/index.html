        <!--
            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph.
            The paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line.

            can place all paragraph text content on one physical line,
            however that would require a lot of scrolling right and left.
            You can have word wrap active in your editor and it will not 
            affect how the browser displays your paragraph content
            You can place your context on separate lines yorself and it 
            will not affect how the browser displays your paragraph content

        -->
        <p> The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when 
            the content is displayed by your browser. The browser does not display 
            your content in the physical style of how you entered your code in html file</p>
        <p> This is a second paragraph on the browser page. It will start a new line.</p>
