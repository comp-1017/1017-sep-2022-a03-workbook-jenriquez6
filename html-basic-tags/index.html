            this structure is a comment block in html files
            everything in this structure is NOT considered part of 
            any conent on your web page.

            Most tag elements in html are done in pairs.
            These are called opening and closing pairs.
            There are some tags that are not in pairs and are referred    
            to as empty tags (void) 

            The opening tag inidicates the start of your element 
            and the closing tag indicates the end of your element.

            The closing tag has the same name as the opening tag plus a slash (/) 
            preceding the name

            The head area of your web page is NOT considered content. 
            The tags within the head area are used by the browser to 
            manage some display of the page, give additional documentation
            to the page, indicate character sets, help with search engines,
            and many other assists.

        <h3>Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <!--
            This is the coding block for your content in a paragraph.
            The paragraph tag belongs to the "block" group of tags
            A "block" group tag places your content on a new line.

            can place all paragraph text content on one physical line,
            however that would require a lot of scrolling right and left.
            You can have word wrap active in your editor and it will not 
            affect how the browser displays your paragraph content
            You can place your context on separate lines yorself and it 
            will not affect how the browser displays your paragraph content

        -->
        <p> The paragraph tag is a block tag. A block tag begins a new line when 
            the content is displayed by your browser. The browser does not display 
            your content in the physical style of how you entered your code in html file</p>
        <p> This is a second paragraph on the browser page. It will start a new line.</p>

        <!-- if you wish to use a component of a reserved tag ( or hte whole tag)
            you would be in trouble using the tag

            of the tag such as (&lt;) and (&gt;)

            - a different web site

            - a different location on the same web page

            href: points to the desired location

                    _blank will open the destination in a new browser tab (page)
